# Denioforms
This small tool allows automatic creation of VLT visual part nodes, to be used in NFS-VltEd tool scripts.

**How to use**: prepare stuff in PartsList.json by looking on Example file, and start jar file. Your ready VLT data will be saved in VLTNodes.txt.

PartsList.json: *Place any Visual Part block from PartsList - Example.json here. Any car or part type combination allowed. Contains 2 Visual Part blocks left here as example.*

PartsList - Example.json: *Visual Part block examples, copy them on PartsList.json file. Use your own titles or default NFSW titles from language files.*
